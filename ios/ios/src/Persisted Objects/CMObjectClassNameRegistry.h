/**
 * The registry that tracks all the custom class names you've registered by overriding +className in
 * your subclasses of <tt>CMObject</tt>. This is a singleton. <b>Do not call <tt>init</tt></b>. Instead use
 * <tt>+sharedInstance</tt> to get the instance of this class.
 *
 * The way this works is by looking up all the subclasses of <tt>CMObject</tt> by using the Objective-C runtime
 * and sends <tt>+className</tt> to each of them. It then records that name as a mapping to the class itself. Remember
 * that <tt>CMObjec</tt> provides a default implementation of <tt>+className</tt> that simply evaluates to
 * <tt>NSStringFromClass([self class])</tt> so you only need to override that method if you are writing a cross-platform
 * app with multiple codebases and need to keep the class names in sync.
