 * This is the high-level interface for interacting with remote objects stored on CloudMine.

 * number of threads and can guarantee that blocking network operations will execute on a background thread.
 *
 * Most apps will only need one store to store and retrieve remote objects. You can use <tt>CMStore#defaultStore</tt>
 * to access this store. It is fully managed for you by the CloudMine SDK.
 *
 * All of the async methods in this class take a callback of type <tt>CMStoreObjectCallback</tt> that will
 * be called with all the object instances once they are finished downloading and inflating.
 *
 * You can subscribe to CMStores using <tt>NSNotificationCenter</tt> and listening for
 * <tt>CMStoreObjectDeletedNotification</tt>. It will be triggered when any object managed by the store
 * is deleted. The <tt>userInfo</tt> dictionary in the <tt>NSNotification</tt> object passed to your handler
 * will contain a mapping of object IDs to the object instances that were deleted.
